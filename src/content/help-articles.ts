        content: `
To maintain the quality and integrity of our database, please follow these guidelines when submitting new podcasts:

1.  **Use Official Sources:** Always use the official YouTube playlist provided by the podcast creator. Do not use fan-made compilations or personal playlists.
2.  **One Podcast Per Submission:** The YouTube playlist should contain episodes from only one podcast. Playlists that mix content from multiple shows will be rejected.
3.  **Ensure Public Accessibility:** The YouTube playlist and its videos must be public. Private or unlisted content cannot be processed.
4.  **Complete Information:** While our system fetches a lot of data automatically, please take the time to fill in any missing information, such as social media links, official websites, and team member roles. The more complete the data, the faster it will be approved.
5.  **Respect Copyright:** Only submit content that is publicly available. Do not upload or link to copyrighted material that you do not have permission to share.

Submissions that do not meet these guidelines may be rejected by our moderation team.

Our ranking system is designed to be transparent and data-driven, reflecting what the community is actively watching and engaging with.

### How are Rankings Calculated?
Rankings are primarily based on a combination of metrics pulled directly from public data sources like YouTube:
- **Total Views:** The cumulative number of views for a podcast or episode.
- **Total Likes:** The cumulative number of likes.
- **Engagement Velocity:** We also consider the rate at which a podcast or episode is gaining new views and likes, especially for our 'Weekly' and 'Monthly' charts. This helps new and trending content to surface.

### Ranking Categories
You can filter rankings by:
- **Content-Type:** View rankings for either whole **Podcasts** or individual **Episodes**.
- **Time Period:**
    - **Weekly:** Shows the top performers over the last 7 days.
    - **Monthly:** Shows the top performers over the last 30 days.
    - **Overall:** Shows the all-time top performers based on cumulative stats.
- **Category:** Filter rankings to a specific genre, like 'Comedy' or 'Technology'.

Our data is synced regularly to ensure the rankings are as up-to-date as possible.

### Authenticity
Your account must represent a real person, registered business, or entity.

Your account must be public and have a bio, profile photo, and at least one post. Your profile can't contain "add me" links to other social media services.

### Maintaining Verification
PodDB reserves the right to remove verification at any time. Reasons for removal may include:
- The account is found to be in violation of our Terms of Service.

- The account holder is no longer eligible for verification.

Losing verification does not necessarily mean you are banned from the platform, but you would need to re-apply if you become eligible again.
