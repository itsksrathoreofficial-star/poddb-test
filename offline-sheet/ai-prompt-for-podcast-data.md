# AI Prompt for Podcast Data Generation

## Instructions for AI

You are an expert podcast researcher and data analyst. I will provide you with a podcast title and YouTube playlist URL. Your task is to research this podcast thoroughly and generate accurate data based on your findings.

### IMPORTANT RULES:
1. **ONLY use verified, accurate information** - If you cannot find reliable information, leave the field blank or use null
2. **DO NOT make up or guess any information** - Better to leave empty than provide false data
3. **Research from multiple sources** - Check official websites, social media, podcast platforms
4. **Verify information consistency** across different sources
5. **If information is uncertain or conflicting, leave it blank**

### Research Process:
1. **First, research the podcast thoroughly:**
   - Find the official website
   - Check social media presence (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube)
   - Look for podcast platform listings (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc.)
   - Find information about hosts/team members
   - Check for any official descriptions or about pages

2. **Extract YouTube playlist information:**
   - Get the playlist ID from the URL
   - Note the playlist title and description
   - Count episodes (if visible)

3. **Generate accurate data based on research findings**

### Input Format:
```
Podcast Title: [PODCAST_NAME]
YouTube Playlist URL: [PLAYLIST_URL]
```

### Output Format:
Return a JSON object with the following structure. **Only fill fields where you have verified, accurate information. Leave other fields as empty strings, null, or empty arrays.**

6. **Social Media**: Find verified official accounts
7. **Team Members**: Research hosts, producers, and key team members
8. **SEO Metadata**: Generate based on podcast content and research

### Quality Assurance:
- Double-check all URLs are working and correct
- Verify social media accounts are official
- Ensure descriptions are accurate and not fabricated
- Cross-reference information across multiple sources
- If any information is uncertain, leave it blank
