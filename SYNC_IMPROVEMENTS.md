# Podcast Sync Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Slug Constraint Violations
**Problem**: Episodes were failing to create due to duplicate slug constraint violations, especially for podcasts with many episodes.

**Solution**:
- Added unique slug generation with database checking
- Implemented retry logic for duplicate slug errors
- Added fallback to timestamp-based slugs if conflicts persist

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Generate unique slug for episode
const baseSlug = episode.title.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-').replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '');
let episodeSlug = baseSlug;
let slugCounter = 1;

// Check for slug uniqueness
while (true) {
  const { data: existingSlug } = await supabase
    .from('episodes')
    .select('id')
    .eq('slug', episodeSlug)
    .single();
  
  if (!existingSlug) break;
  
  episodeSlug = `${baseSlug}-${slugCounter}`;
  slugCounter++;
}
```

### 2. Network Timeout Issues
**Problem**: 522 errors and upstream request timeouts were causing sync failures, especially for large datasets.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implemented specific handling for different error types (timeout, 522, upstream)
- Added progressive delays for large datasets

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Check if it's a network/timeout error that we should retry
const isRetryableError = statsError.message.includes('timeout') || 
                        statsError.message.includes('Connection timed out') ||
                        statsError.message.includes('upstream request timeout') ||
                        statsError.message.includes('522') ||
                        statsError.message.includes('ETIMEDOUT') ||
                        statsError.message.includes('ENOTFOUND');

if (isRetryableError && retryCount < maxRetries - 1) {
  retryCount++;
  const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, retryCount), 5000); // Exponential backoff, max 5s
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  continue;
}
```

### 3. Large Dataset Processing Issues
**Problem**: Podcasts with 2300+ episodes were causing memory issues and overwhelming the database.

**Solution**:
- Implemented adaptive chunking based on dataset size
- Added concurrency control for large datasets
- Implemented progressive delays between chunks
- Added memory optimization after each chunk

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Use smaller chunks for large datasets to prevent memory issues
const isLargeDataset = episodes.length > 1000;
const adaptiveChunkSize = isLargeDataset ? Math.min(50, chunkSize) : chunkSize;
const episodeChunks = chunkArray(episodes, adaptiveChunkSize);

// Process episodes with concurrency control
const maxConcurrency = isLargeDataset ? 3 : 8;

// Add delay between chunks for large datasets
if (isLargeDataset && chunkIndex > 0) {
  const delay = Math.min(2000, chunkIndex * 100); // Progressive delay up to 2s
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
}
```

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery
**Problem**: Sync process would fail completely when encountering errors, especially for large datasets.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error categorization and logging
- Implemented graceful error recovery for large datasets
- Added error rate monitoring and warnings
- Improved error reporting and debugging information

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Check for critical errors and decide whether to continue
const errorRate = failedEpisodes / (successfulEpisodes + failedEpisodes);
if (errorRate > 0.5 && episodes.length > 100) {
  logDetailed(`High error rate detected (${Math.round(errorRate * 100)}%), but continuing due to large dataset`, 'WARN', podcast.title);
}
```

### 5. Progress Tracking and Monitoring
**Problem**: No visibility into sync progress for large datasets, making it difficult to monitor and debug.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced progress tracking with detailed metrics
- Added real-time progress updates during processing
- Implemented better logging for large datasets
- Added performance monitoring and reporting

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Update progress after each batch
const currentProcessed = successfulEpisodes + failedEpisodes + chunkResults.length;
updateDetailedProgress({
  currentOperation: `processing_episodes (${chunkIndex + 1}/${episodeChunks.length} chunks, batch ${Math.floor(i/maxConcurrency) + 1})`,
  processedEpisodesInCurrentPodcast: currentProcessed,
  currentEpisodeIndex: currentProcessed,
  totalEpisodesInCurrentPodcast: episodes.length
});

// Log progress for large datasets
if (isLargeDataset && (chunkIndex + 1) % 5 === 0) {
  const progress = Math.round(((chunkIndex + 1) / episodeChunks.length) * 100);
  logDetailed(`Progress: ${progress}% (${successfulEpisodes + failedEpisodes}/${episodes.length} episodes processed)`, 'INFO', podcast.title);
}
```

## New Features

## Usage

### Running the Sync
The sync process now automatically detects large datasets and applies appropriate optimizations:

```bash
# Start the sync server
cd sync-server
npm start

# Or run manually
node server.js
```

### Fixing Existing Duplicates
```bash
# Run the duplicate cleanup script
node fix-duplicate-episodes.js
```

### Testing Improvements

# Run the test script
node test-sync-improvements.js
```

## Monitoring

## Expected Results

### For Large Podcasts (2300+ episodes)
- ✅ No more memory issues
- ✅ Reduced timeout errors
- ✅ Better progress visibility
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Improved success rates

### For All Podcasts
- ✅ No more duplicate slug errors
- ✅ Better network resilience
- ✅ Improved error recovery
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring and debugging
- ✅ More reliable sync process

## Configuration

The sync process now supports adaptive configuration based on dataset size:

- **Small datasets (< 1000 episodes)**: Normal processing with 8 concurrent operations
- **Large datasets (1000+ episodes)**: Optimized processing with 3 concurrent operations
- **Chunk sizes**: Adaptive based on dataset size (50 for large, 100+ for small)
- **Delays**: Progressive delays for large datasets to prevent overwhelming

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Still getting timeout errors**: Check network connectivity and Supabase status
2. **Memory issues**: Ensure adequate server resources
3. **Duplicate slugs**: Run the cleanup script
4. **High error rates**: Check API quotas and database performance

### Debug Information
- Check sync logs in `sync-server/logs/`
- Use the test script to identify issues
- Monitor progress in the admin panel
- Review error analysis in detailed logs
